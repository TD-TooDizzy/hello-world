My first Repository

Hello Everyone,

My name is Tyler Dimond, I'm 25 years old who has a passion for learning new skills, especially programming languages. Using git to help me get up to par with development standards and write cleaner code. The programming languages I mostly want to learn is Python and C++ for developing apps and creating fun interactive video games.

Best,
Tyler Dimond
